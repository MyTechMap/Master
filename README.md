## Our Goal
Our goal with this project is to create an attractive, functional and feature-rich map website for the beautiful Texas Tech university campus. The current map
website used by Texas Tech is not liked by many students and could be greatly improved.

## How
We will be building this map using the MERN technology stack. This means our map will be storing user data and locations in a MongoDB database. Our front-end
will be built using React.js so that we may easily manipulate the DOM to dsiplay the data our uesrs need to get around campus. For the map we will be using
the Google Maps API and customizing it to focus only on Texas Tech Campus.
